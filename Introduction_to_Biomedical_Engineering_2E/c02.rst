Deﬁne and distinguish between the terms morals and ethics.

Present the rationale underlying two major philosophical schools of thought: utilitarianism and 
nonconsequentialism.

Present the codes of ethics for the medical profession, nursing profession, and biomedical engineering.

Identify the modern moral dilemmas, including redeﬁning death, deciding how to care for the terminally ill, 
and experimentation on humans, which arise from the two moral norms: beneﬁcence (the provision of beneﬁts) 
and nonmaleﬁcence (the avoidance of harm).

Discuss the moral judgments associated with present policies regarding the regulation of the development and 
use of new medical devices.

The tremendous infusion of technology into the practice of medicine has created a new medical era. Advances 
in material science have led to the production of artiﬁcial limbs, heart valves, and blood vessels, thereby 
permitting ‘‘spare-parts’’ surgery. Numerous patient disorders are now routinely diagnosed using a wide 
range of highly sophisticated imaging devices, and the lives of many patients are being extended through 
signiﬁcant improvements in resuscitative and supportive devices such as respirators, pacemakers, and 
artiﬁcial kidneys.

These technological advances, however, have not been entirely benign. They have had signiﬁcant moral 
consequences. Provided with the ability to develop cardiovascular assist devices, perform organ transplants, 
and maintain the breathing and heartbeat of terminally ill patients, society has been forced to reexamine 
the meaning of such terms as death, quality of life, heroic efforts, and acts of mercy, and consider such 
moral issues as the right of patients to refuse treatment (living wills) and to participate in experiments 
(informed consent). As a result, these technological advances have made the moral dimensions of health care 
more complex, and have posed new and troubling moral dilemmas for medical professionals, biomedical 
engineers, and society at large.

The purpose of this chapter is to examine some of the moral questions related to the use of new medical 
technologies. The objective, however, is not to provide solutions or recommendations for these questions. 
Rather, the intent is to demonstrate that each technological advance has consequences that affect the very 
core of human values.

Technology and ethics are not foreigners; they are neighbors in the world of human accomplishment. 
Technology is a human achievement of extraordinary ingenuity and utility and is quite distant from the human 
accomplishment of ethical values. They face each other, rather than interface. The personal face of ethics 
looks at the impersonal face of technology to comprehend technology’s potential and its limits. The face of 
technology looks to ethics to be directed to human purposes and beneﬁts.

In the process of making technology and ethics face each other, it is our hope that individuals engaged in 
the development of new medical devices, as well as those responsible for the care of patients, will be 
stimulated to examine and evaluate critically ‘‘accepted’’ views and to reach their own conclusions. This 
chapter, there-

fore, begins with some deﬁnitions related to morality and ethics, followed by a more detailed discussion of 
some of the moral issues of special importance to biomedical engineers.

2.1 MORALITY AND ETHICS: A DEFINITION OF TERMS

From the very beginning, individuals have raised concerns about the nature of life and its signiﬁcance. 
Many of these concerns have been incorporated into the four fundamental questions posed by the German 
philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804): What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope? What is man? 
Evidence that early societies raised these questions can be found in the generation of rather complex codes 
of conduct embedded in the customs of the earliest human social organization, the tribe. By 600 BC , the 
Greeks were successful in reducing many primitive speculations, attitudes, and views on these questions to 
some type of order or system and integrating them into the general body of wisdom called philosophy. Being 
seafarers and colonizers, the Greeks had close contact with many different peoples and cultures. In the 
process, struck by the variety of customs, laws, and institutions that prevailed in the societies that 
surrounded them, they began to examine and compare all human conduct in these societies. This part of 
philosophy they called ethics.

The term ethics comes from the Greek ethos, meaning ‘‘custom.’’ On the other hand, the Latin word for custom 
is mos, and its plural, mores, is the equivalent of the Greek ethos and the root of the words moral and 
morality. Although both terms (ethics and morality) are often used interchangeably, there is a distinction 
between them that should be made.

Philosophers deﬁne ethics as a particular kind of study and use morality to refer to its subject matter. 
For example, customs that result from some abiding principal human interaction are called morals. Some 
examples of morals in our society are telling the truth, paying one’s debts, honoring one’s parents, and 
respecting the rights and property of others. Most members of society usually consider such conduct not only 
customary but also correct or right. Thus, morality encompasses what people believe to be right and good and 
the reasons they give for it.

Most of us follow these rules of conduct and adjust our lifestyles in accordance with the principles they 
represent. Many even sacriﬁce life itself rather than diverge from them, applying them not only to their 
own conduct, but also to the behavior of others. Individuals who disregard these accepted codes of conduct 
are considered deviants and, in many cases, are punished for engaging in an activity that society as a whole 
considers unacceptable. For example, individuals committing ‘‘criminal acts’’ (deﬁned by society) are often 
‘‘outlawed’’ and, in many cases, severely punished. These judgments regarding codes of conduct, however, are 
not inﬂexible; they must continually be modiﬁed to ﬁt changing conditions and thereby avoid the trauma of 
revolution as the vehicle for change.

Morality represents the codes of conduct of a society, but ethics is the study of right and wrong, of good 
and evil in human conduct. Ethics is not concerned with providing any judgments or speciﬁc rules for human 
behavior, but rather with providing an

objective analysis about what individuals ‘‘ought to do.’’ Deﬁned in this way, it represents the 
philosophical view of morals, and, therefore, is often referred to as moral philosophy.

Consider the following three questions: (1) Should badly deformed infants be kept alive?; (2) Should 
treatment be stopped to allow a terminally ill patient to die?; (3) Should humans be used in experiments? 
Are these questions of morality or ethics? In terms of the deﬁnitions just provided, all three of these 
inquiries are questions of moral judgment.

Philosophers argue that all moral judgments are considered to be normative judgments, which can be 
recognized simply by their characteristic evaluative terms such as good, bad, right, or wrong. Typical 
normative judgments include

& & &

Stealing is wrong.

Everyone ought to have access to an education. Voluntary euthanasia should not be legalized.

Each of these judgments expresses an evaluation (i.e., conveys a negative or positive attitude toward some 
state of affairs). Each, therefore, is intended to play an actionguiding function.

Arriving at moral judgments, however, requires knowledge of valid moral standards in our society. How is 
such knowledge obtained? The efforts to answer this question lie in two competing schools of thought that 
currently dominate normative ethical theory: utilitarianism, a form of consequentialism, and Kantianism, a 
form of nonconsequentialism. Consequentialism holds that the morally right action is always the one among 
the available options that has the best consequences. An important implication of consequentialism is that 
no speciﬁc actions or courses of conduct are automatically ruled out as immoral or ruled in as morally 
obligatory. The rightness or wrongness of an action is wholly contingent upon its effects.

According to utilitarianism, there are two steps to determining what ought to be done in any situation. 
First, determine which courses of action are open. Second, determine the consequences of each alternative. 
When this has been accomplished, the morally right course of action is the one that maximizes pleasure, 
minimizes pain, or both; the one that does the ‘‘greatest good for the greatest number.’’ Because the 
central motivation driving the design, development, and use of medical devices is improvement of medicine’s 
capacity to protect and restore health, an obvious virtue of utilitarianism is that it assesses medical 
technology in terms of what many believe makes health valuable: the attainment of well-being and the 
avoidance of pain.

Utilitarianism, therefore, advocates that the end justiﬁes the means. As long as any form of treatment 
maximizes good consequences, it should be used. Many people, though, believe that the end does not always 
justify the means and that individuals have rights that are not to be violated no matter how good the 
consequences might be.

In opposition to utilitarianism stands the school of normative ethical thought known as nonconsequentialism. 
Proponents of this school deny that moral evaluation is simply and wholly a matter of determining the 
consequences of human conduct. They agree that other considerations are relevant to moral assessment and so 
reject the view that morally right conduct is whatever has the best consequences. Based largely on the views 
of Immanuel Kant, this ethical school of thought insists that there

is something uniquely precious about human beings from the moral point of view. According to Kant’s theory, 
humans have certain rights that do not apply to any other animal. For example, the moral judgments that we 
should not kill and eat each other for food or hunt each other for sport or experiment on each other for 
medical science are all based on this view of human rights. Humans are, in short, owed a special kind of 
respect simply because they are people.

To better understand the Kantian perspective, it may be helpful to recognize that Kant’s views are an 
attempt to capture in secular form a basic tenet of Christian morality. What makes human beings morally 
special entities deserving a unique type of respect? Christianity answers in terms of the doctrine of 
ensoulment. This doctrine holds that only human beings are divinely endowed with an eternal soul. According 
to Christian ethics, the soul makes humans the only beings with intrinsic value. Kant’s secular version of 
the doctrine of ensoulment asserts that human beings are morally unique and deserve special respect because 
of their autonomy. Autonomy is taken by Kant to be the capacity to make choices based on rational 
deliberation. The central task of ethics then is to specify what human conduct is required to respect the 
unique dignity of human beings. For most Kantians, this means determining what limits human beings must 
observe in the way they treat each other and this, in turn, is taken to be a matter of specifying each 
individual’s fundamental moral rights.

These two ethical schools of thought, therefore, provide some rationale for moral judgments. However, when 
there is no clear moral judgment, one is faced with a dilemma. In medicine, moral dilemmas arise in those 
situations that raise fundamental questions about right and wrong in the treatment of sickness and the 
promotion of health in patients. In many of these situations the health professional faces two alternative 
choices, neither of which seems to be a satisfactory solution to the problem. For example, is it more 
important to preserve life or prevent pain? Is it right to withhold treatment when doing so may lead to a 
shortening of life? Does an individual have the right to refuse treatment when refusing it may lead to 
death? All these situations seem to have no clear-cut imperative based on our present set of convictions 
about right and wrong. That is the dilemma raised by Kant: what ought I do?

Case Study: Stem Cell Research

At the moment of conception, that is to say when sperm unites with egg, the process of fertilization occurs 
(Fig 2.1). The formation of an embryo is initiated. Once the sperm enters the egg, there is an immediate 
opening of ion channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane of the cell, and prevents other sperm from 
fusing with it. DNA replication then begins, and the ﬁrst cell division occurs approximately 36 hours 
later. As the process continues, the cell begins to experience cleavage, in which the cells repeatedly 
divide, cycling between the S (DNA synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases of cell division, essentially skipping 
the G 1 and G 2 phases, when most cell growth normally occurs. Thus, there is no net growth of the cells, 
merely subdivision into smaller cells, individually called blastomeres.

Five days subsequent to fertilization, the number of cells composing the embryo is in the hundreds, and the 
cells form tight junctions characteristic of a compact epithelium, which is arranged around a central 
cavity. This is the embryonic stage known as the blastocyst. Within the cavity exists a mass of cells that 
protrude inward. These cells are known as the inner cell mass and become the embryo. The exterior cells are 
the trophoblast and eventually form the placenta. It is the cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst 
that, when isolated and grown in a culture, are identiﬁed as embryonic stem cells.

It is important to note that if cell division continues, determination and differentiation happen. 
Differentiation occurs when a cell begins to exhibit the speciﬁc attributes of a predestined specialized 
cellular role. Determination is related to differentiation, but is somewhat dissimilar. When a cell group 
that has been determined is transplanted, it will not assimilate with the other cells, but will rather grow 
into cells that comprised the original organ it was destined to become.

Because the process of obtaining embryonic stem cells destroys the embryo, the following questions arise:

Is the embryo a living human being, entitled to all of the same rights that a human at any other age would 
be granted? Discuss the answer to this question from a utilitarian and a Kantian point of view.

Should any research that is potentially beneﬁcial to the well-being of mankind be pursued?

Should the federal government support such research?

In the practice of medicine, moral dilemmas are certainly not new. They have been present throughout medical 
history. As a result, over the years there have been efforts to provide a set of guidelines for those 
responsible for patient care. These efforts have resulted in the development of speciﬁc codes of 
professional conduct. Let us examine some of these codes or guidelines.

For the medical profession, the World Medical Association adopted a version of the Hippocratic oath entitled 
the Geneva Convention Code of Medical Ethics in 1949. This declaration contains the following statements:

I solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the services of humanity; I will give to my teachers the 
respect and gratitude which is their due; I will practice my profession with conscience and dignity; The 
health of my patient will be my ﬁrst consideration; I will respect the secrets which are conﬁded in me; I 
will maintain by all the means in my power, the honour and the noble traditions of the medical profession; 
My colleagues will be my brothers; I will not permit considerations of religion, nationality, race, party 
politics or social standing to intervene between my duty and my patient; I will maintain the utmost respect 
for human life from the time of conception; even under threat; I will not use my medical knowledge contrary 
to the laws of humanity; I make these promises solemnly, freely and upon my honour.

In the United States, the American Medical Association (AMA) adopted a set of Principles of Medical Ethics 
in 1980, and revised them in June, 2001. Following is a comparison of the two sets of principles.

For the nursing profession, the American Nurses Association formally adopted in 1976 the Code For Nurses, 
whose statements and interpretations provide guidance for conduct and relationships in carrying out nursing 
responsibilities.

PREAMBLE: The Code for Nurses is based on belief about the nature of individuals, nursing, health, and 
society. Recipients and providers of nursing services are viewed as individuals and groups who possess basic 
rights and responsibilities, and whose values and circumstances command respect at all times. Nursing 
encompasses the promotion and restoration of health, the prevention of illness, and the alleviation of 
suffering. The statements of the Code and their interpretation provide guidance for conduct and

relationships in carrying out nursing responsibilities consistent with the ethical obligations of the 
profession and quality in nursing care.

1. The nurse provides services with respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of the client unrestricted 
by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems.

2. The nurse safeguards the client’s right to privacy by judiciously protecting information of a 
conﬁdential nature.

3. The nurse acts to safeguard the client and the public when health care and safety are affected by the 
incompetent, unethical, or illegal practice of any person.

4. The nurse assumes responsibility and accountability for individual nursing judgments and actions.

5. The nurse maintains competence in nursing.

6. The nurse exercises informed judgment and uses individual competence and qualiﬁcations as criteria in 
seeking consultation, accepting responsibilities, and delegating nursing activities to others.

7. The nurse participates in activities that contribute to the ongoing development of the profession’s body 
of knowledge.

8. The nurse participates in the profession’s efforts to implement and improve standards of nursing.

9. The nurse participates in the profession’s efforts to establish and maintain conditions of employment 
conducive to high-quality nursing care.

10. The nurse participates in the profession’s effort to protect the public from misinformation and 
misrepresentation and to maintain the integrity of nursing.

11. The nurse collaborates with members of the health professions and other citizens in promoting community 
and national efforts to meet the health needs of the public.

These codes take as their guiding principle the concepts of service to humankind and respect for human life. 
When reading these codes of conduct, it is difﬁcult to imagine that anyone could improve on them as summary 
statements of the primary goals of individuals responsible for the care of patients. However, some believe 
that such codes fail to provide answers to many of the difﬁcult moral dilemmas confronting health 
professionals today. For example, in many situations, all the fundamental responsibilities of the nurse 
cannot be met at the same time. When a patient suffering from a massive insult to the brain is kept alive by 
artiﬁcial means and this equipment is needed elsewhere, it is not clear from these guidelines how ‘‘nursing 
competence is to be maintained to conserve life and promote health.’’ Although it may be argued that the 
decision to treat or not to treat is a medical and not a nursing decision, both professions are so 
intimately involved in the care of patients that they are both concerned with the ultimate implications of 
any such decision.

For biomedical engineers, an increased awareness of the ethical signiﬁcance of their professional 
activities has also resulted in the development of codes of professional ethics. Typically consisting of a 
short list of general rules, these codes express both the minimal standards to which all members of a 
profession are expected to conform and the ideals for which all members are expected to strive. Such codes 
provide a practical guide for the ethical conduct of the profession’s practitioners. Consider, for example, 
the code of ethics endorsed by the American College of Clinical Engineers:

As a member of the American College of Clinical Engineering, I subscribe to the established Code of Ethics 
in that I will:

&

& & & & &

&

Accurately represent my level of responsibility, authority, experience, knowledge, and education.

Strive to prevent a person from being placed at risk due to the use of technology. Reveal conﬂicts of 
interest that may affect information provided or received. Respect the conﬁdentiality of information.

Work toward improving the delivery of health care.

Work toward the containment of costs by the better management and utilization of technology.

Promote the profession of clinical engineering.

Although these codes can be useful in promoting ethical conduct, such rules obviously cannot provide ethical 
guidance in every situation. A profession that aims to maximize the ethical conduct of its members must not 
limit the ethical consciousness of its members to knowledge of their professional code alone. It must also 
provide them with resources that will enable them to determine what the code requires in a particular 
concrete situation, and thereby enable them to arrive at ethically sound judgments in situations in which 
the directives of the code are ambiguous or simply do not apply.

2.2 TWO MORAL NORMS: BENEFICENCE AND NONMALEFICENCE

Two moral norms have remained relatively constant across the various moral codes and oaths that have been 
formulated for health care providers since the beginnings of Western medicine in classical Greek 
civilization. They are beneﬁcence, the provision of beneﬁts, and nonmaleﬁcence, the avoidance of doing 
harm. These norms are traced back to a body of writings from classical antiquity known as the Hippocratic 
Corpus. Although these writings are associated with the name of Hippocrates, the acknowledged founder of 
Western medicine, medical historians remain uncertain whether any, including the Hippocratic oath, were 
actually his work. Although portions of the Corpus are believed to have been authored during the sixth 
century BC , other portions are believed to have been written as late as the beginning of the Christian era. 
Medical historians agree that many of the speciﬁc moral directives of the Corpus represent neither the 
actual practices nor the moral ideals of the majority of physicians of ancient Greece and Rome.

Nonetheless, the general injunction, ‘‘As to disease, make a habit of two things: (1) to help or, (2) at 
least, to do no harm,’’ was accepted as a fundamental medical ethical norm by at least some ancient 
physicians. With the decline of Hellenistic civilization and the rise of Christianity, beneﬁcence and 
nonmaleﬁcence became increasingly accepted as the fundamental principles of morally sound medical practice. 
Although beneﬁcence and nonmaleﬁcence were regarded merely as concomitant to the craft of medicine in 
classical Greece and Rome, the emphasis upon compassion and the brotherhood of humankind, central to 
Christianity, increasingly made these norms

the only acceptable motives for medical practice. Even today, the provision of beneﬁts and the avoidance of 
doing harm are stressed just as much in virtually all contemporary Western codes of conduct for health 
professionals as they were in the oaths and codes that guided the health care providers of past centuries.

Traditionally, the ethics of medical care have given greater prominence to nonmaleﬁcence than to 
beneﬁcence. This priority was grounded in the fact that, historically, medicine’s capacity to do harm far 
exceeded its capacity to protect and restore health. Providers of health care possessed many treatments that 
posed clear and genuine risks to patients and that offered little prospect of beneﬁt. Truly effective 
therapies were all too rare. In this context, it is surely rational to give substantially higher priority to 
avoiding harm than to providing beneﬁts.

The advent of modern science changed matters dramatically. Knowledge acquired in laboratories, tested in 
clinics, and veriﬁed by statistical methods has increasingly dictated the practice of medicine. This 
ongoing alliance between medicine and science became a critical source of the plethora of technologies that 
now pervade medical care. The impressive increases in therapeutic, preventive, and rehabilitative 
capabilities that these technologies have provided have pushed beneﬁcence to the forefront of medical 
morality. Some have even gone so far as to hold that the old medical ethic of ‘‘Above all, do no harm’’ 
should be superseded by the new ethic that ‘‘The patient deserves the best.’’ However, the rapid advances in 
medical technology capabilities have also produced great uncertainty as to what is most beneﬁcial or least 
harmful for the patient. In other words, along with increases in the ability to be beneﬁcent, medicine’s 
technology has generated much debate about what actually counts as beneﬁcent or nonmaleﬁcent treatment. 
Having reviewed some of the fundamental concepts of ethics and morality, let us now turn to several speciﬁc 
moral issues posed by the use of medical technology.

2.3 REDEFINING DEATH

Although medicine has long been involved in the observation and certiﬁcation of death, many of its 
practitioners have not always expressed philosophical concerns regarding the beginning of life and the onset 
of death. Since medicine is a clinical and empirical science, it would seem that health professionals had no 
medical need to consider the concept of death; the fact of death was sufﬁcient. The distinction between 
life and death was viewed as the comparison of two extreme conditions separated by an inﬁnite chasm. With 
the advent of technological advances in medicine to assist health professionals to prolong life, this view 
has changed.

There is no doubt that the use of medical technology has in many instances warded off the coming of the grim 
reaper. One need only look at the trends in average life expectancy for conﬁrmation. For example, in the 
United States today, the average life expectancy for males is 74.3 years and for females 76 years, whereas 
in 1900 the average life expectancy for both sexes was only 47 years. Infant mortality has been 
signiﬁcantly reduced in developed nations where technology is an integral part of the culture. Premature 
births no longer constitute a threat to life because of the

artiﬁcial environment that medical technology can provide. Today, technology has not only helped 
individuals avoid early death but has also been effective in delaying the inevitable. Pacemakers, artiﬁcial 
kidneys, and a variety of other medical devices have enabled individuals to add many more productive years 
to their lives. Technology has been so successful that health professionals responsible for the care of 
critically ill patients have been able to maintain their ‘‘vital signs of life’’ for extensive periods of 
time. In the process, however, serious philosophical questions concerning the quality of the life provided 
to these patients have arisen.

Consider the case of the patient who sustains a serious head injury in an automobile accident. To the 
attendants in the ambulance who reached the scene of the accident, the patient was unconscious, but still 
alive with a beating heart. After the victim was rushed to the hospital and into the emergency room, the 
resident in charge veriﬁed the stability of the vital signs of heartbeat and respiration during examination 
and ordered a computerized tomography (CT) scan to indicate the extent of the head injury. The results of 
this procedure clearly showed extensive brain damage. When the EEG was obtained from the scalp electrodes 
placed about the head, it was noted to be signiﬁcantly abnormal. In this situation, then, the obvious 
questions arise: What is the status of the patient? Is the patient alive?

Alternatively, consider the events encountered during one open-heart surgery. During this procedure, the 
patient was placed on the heart bypass machine while the surgeon attempted to correct a malfunctioning 
valve. As the complex and long operation continued, the EEG monitors that had indicated a normal pattern of 
electrical activity at the onset of the operation suddenly displayed a relatively straight line indicative 
of feeble electrical activity. However, since the heart–lung bypass was maintaining the patient’s so-called 
vital signs, what should the surgeon do? Should the medical staff continue on the basis that the patient is 
alive, or is the patient dead?

The increasing occurrence of these situations has stimulated health professionals to reexamine the 
deﬁnition of death. In essence, advances in medical technology that delay death actually hastened its 
redeﬁnition. This should not be so surprising because the deﬁnition of death has always been closely 
related to the extent of medical knowledge and available technology. For many centuries, death was deﬁned 
solely as the absence of breathing. Since it was felt that the spirit of the human being resided in the 
spiritus (breath), its absence became indicative of death. With the continuing proliferation of scientiﬁc 
information regarding human physiology and the development of techniques to revive a nonbreathing person, 
attention turned to the pulsating heart as the focal point in determination of death. However, this view was 
to change through additional medical and technological advances in supportive therapy, resuscitation, 
cardiovascular assist devices, and organ transplantation.

As understanding of the human organism increased, it became obvious that one of the primary constituents of 
the blood is oxygen and that any organ deprived of oxygen for a speciﬁed period of time will cease to 
function and die. The higher functions of the brain are particularly vulnerable to this type of insult, and 
the removal of oxygen from the blood supply even for a short period of time (3 minutes) produces 
irreversible damage to the brain tissues. Consequently, the evidence of death began to shift from the 
pulsating heart to the vital, functioning brain. Once medicine was provided

with the means to monitor the brain’s activity (i.e., the EEG), another factor was introduced in the 
deﬁnition of death. Advocates of the concept of brain death argued that the human brain is truly essential 
to life. When the brain is irreversibly damaged, so are the functions that are identiﬁed with self and our 
own humanness: memory, feeling, thinking, and knowledge.

As a result, it became widely accepted that in clinical death the spontaneous activity of the lungs, heart, 
and brain is no longer present. The irreversible cessation of functioning of all three major organs (i.e., 
heart, lungs, and brain) was required before anyone was pronounced dead. Although damage to any other organ 
system such as the liver or kidney may ultimately cause the death of the individual through a fatal effect 
on the essential functions of the heart, lungs, or brain, this aspect was not included in the deﬁnition of 
clinical death.

With the development of modern respirators, however, the medical profession encountered an increasing number 
of situations in which a patient with irreversible brain damage could be maintained almost indeﬁnitely. 
Once again, a new technological advance created the need to reexamine the deﬁnition of death.

The movement toward redeﬁning death received considerable impetus with the publication of a report 
sponsored by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School in 1968, in which the committee offered an 
alternative deﬁnition of death based on the functioning of the brain. The report of this committee was 
considered a landmark attempt to deal with death in light of technology.

In summary, the criteria for death established by this committee included the following: (1) the patient 
must be unreceptive and unresponsive, that is, in a state of irreversible coma; (2) the patient must have no 
movements of breathing when the mechanical respirator is turned off; (3) the patient must not demonstrate 
any reﬂexes; and (4) the patient must have a ﬂat EEG for at least 24 hours, indicating no electrical brain 
activity. When these criteria are satisﬁed, then death may be declared.

At the time, the committee also strongly recommended that the decision to declare the person dead and then 
to turn off the respirator should not be made by physicians involved in any later efforts to transplant 
organs or tissues from the deceased individual. In this way, a prospective donor’s death would not be 
hastened merely for the purpose of transplantation. Thus, complete separation of authority and 
responsibility for the care of the recipient from the physician or group of physicians responsible for the 
care of the prospective donor is essential.

The shift to a brain-oriented concept involved deciding that much more than just biological life is 
necessary to be a human person. The brain death concept was essentially a statement that mere vegetative 
human life is not personal human life. In other words, an otherwise intact and alive but brain-dead person 
is not a human person. Many of us have taken for granted the assertion that being truly alive in this world 
requires an ‘‘intact functioning brain.’’ Yet, precisely this issue was at stake in the gradual movement 
from using heartbeat and respiration as indices of life to using brain-oriented indices instead.

Indeed, total and irreparable loss of brain function, referred to as brainstem death, whole brain death, or, 
simply, brain death, has been widely accepted as the legal standard for death. By this standard, an 
individual in a state of brain death is legally

indistinguishable from a corpse and may be legally treated as one even though respiratory and circulatory 
functions may be sustained through the intervention of technology. Many take this legal standard to be the 
morally appropriate one, noting that once destruction of the brain stem has occurred, the brain cannot 
function at all, and the body’s regulatory mechanisms will fail unless artiﬁcially sustained. Thus 
mechanical sustenance of an individual in a state of brain death is merely postponement of the inevitable 
and sustains nothing of the personality, character, or consciousness of the individual. It is simply the 
mechanical intervention that differentiates such an individual from a corpse and a mechanically ventilated 
corpse is a corpse nonetheless.

Even with a consensus that brainstem death is death, and thus that an individual in such a state is indeed a 
corpse, difﬁcult cases remain. Consider the case of an individual in a persistent vegetative state, the 
condition known as neocortical death. Although severe brain injury has been suffered, enough brain function 
remains to make mechanical sustenance of respiration and circulation unnecessary. In a persistent vegetative 
state, an individual exhibits no purposeful response to external stimuli and no evidence of self-awareness. 
The eyes may open periodically and the individual may exhibit sleep–wake cycles. Some patients even yawn, 
make chewing motions, or swallow spontaneously. Unlike the complete unresponsiveness of individuals in a 
state of brainstem death, a variety of simple and complex responses can be elicited from an individual in a 
persistent vegetative state. Nonetheless, the chances that such an individual will regain consciousness are 
remote. Artiﬁcial feeding, kidney dialysis, and the like make it possible to sustain an individual in a 
state of neocortical death for decades. This sort of condition and the issues it raises are exempliﬁed by 
the famous case of Karen Ann Quinlan.

In April 1975, this young woman suffered severe brain damage and was reduced to a chronic vegetative state 
in which she no longer had any cognitive function. Accepting the doctors’ judgment that there was no hope of 
recovery, her parents sought permission from the courts to disconnect the respirator that was keeping her 
alive in the intensive care unit of a New Jersey hospital.

The trial court, and then the Supreme Court of New Jersey, agreed that Karen’s respirator could be removed. 
So it was disconnected. However, the nurse in charge of her care in the Catholic hospital opposed this 
decision and, anticipating it, had begun to wean her from the respirator so that by the time it was 
disconnected she could remain alive without it. So, Karen did not die. She remained alive for ten additional 
years. In June 1985, she ﬁnally died of acute pneumonia. Antibiotics, which would have fought the 
pneumonia, were not given.

If brainstem death is death, is neocortical death also death? Again, the issue is not a straightforward 
factual matter. For it, too, is a matter of specifying which features of living individuals distinguish them 
from corpses and so make treatment of them as corpses morally impermissible. Irreparable cessation of 
respiration and circulation, the classical criterion for death, would entail that an individual in a 
persistent vegetative state is not a corpse and so, morally speaking, must not be treated as one. The 
brainstem death criterion for death would also entail that a person in a state of neocortical death is not 
yet a corpse. On this criterion, what is crucial is that brain damage be severe enough to cause failure of 
the regulatory mechanisms of the body.
